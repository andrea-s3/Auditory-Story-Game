# Auditory-Story-Game
This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with other two team members: Alexialeonllopez and Krystelle Barroso. The purpose of this project is to create more inclusiveness for people who are visually impaired, by providing them with an auditory story-based game.

We used the p5 javascript library to add sound to our story. This way, the user can hear the game's story instead of reading it. 

If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
